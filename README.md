# arduino-lcd-emu

dumb setup for emulating lcd / adafruit_gfx for testing 

## setup / usage

install SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/)
build using cmake 
magic!

## notes

whole piles of code copied from random places
(basically everything Adafruit_, and several bits from arduino framework
to get the interfaces to make arduino-sketch-like programs to compile without
any mods)
